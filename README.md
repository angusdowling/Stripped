Stripped
========
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Stripped is a Drupal theme where all the fluff of Drupal has been taken away. Assets are currently uploaded.
Stripped uses the powerful CSS preprocessor 'SASS' to do a lot of heavy lifting. There are several mixins that come with Stripped:

Baseline Grid: a mixin that quickly calculates a baseline grid, useful for fast and easy vertical rhythm. Also includes font sizing mixin.
Columns: Allowing easy collaboration between designer and developer, this mixin makes it childs play to align elements to any amount of columns.
