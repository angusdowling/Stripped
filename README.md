Stripped
========
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Stripped is a Drupal theme where all the fluff of Drupal has been taken away. Assets are currently uploaded.</p>

<h3>Functionality</h3>
<p>Stripped uses the powerful CSS preprocessor 'SASS' to do a lot of heavy lifting. There are several mixins that come with Stripped:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Baseline Grid</strong>: a mixin that quickly calculates a baseline grid, useful for fast and easy vertical rhythm. Also includes font sizing mixin.</li>
  <li><strong>Columns</strong>: Allowing easy collaboration between designer and developer, this mixin makes it childs play to align elements to any amount of columns.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stripped also includes template files from the following commonly used modules:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Views</li>
  <li>Webform</li>
</ul>

<h3>A thanks to</h3>
